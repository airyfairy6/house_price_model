# house_price_model
In this project, we model house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. We focus on:  - Building regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest) - Evaluating them with RMSE, MAE, and R² - Using feature selection / regularization to identify important predictors - Comparing simple and more complex models
